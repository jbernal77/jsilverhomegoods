<h2>Shipping Information</h2>

<p>Upon placing your order, you will be given options for shipping. You can expect your package to arrive within 1-2 business days if you are located inside Windsor-Essex County. If you
    are located outside of the area, expect your package to arrive within 3-5 business days. There is also an option to decline shipping, and pick up at our location at 123 Fake Street, Windsor ON. You will
    not be charged for shipping and handling if you choose this option. <br>
    There is a flat fee of $5 for any package shipped outside of Windsor/Essex. Any orders placed outside of Ontario will be subject to an additional $5 fee for long distance shipping. This does not include duty fees at the border.<br>
    Every product that we ship is carefully packed and protected with environmentally friendly packaging. We want to ensure that all of our products arrive in one piece. For any shipping concerns, please contact us at jsilverhomegoodsshipping@gmail.com
