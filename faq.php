        <h4>FAQ</h4>
        <p><b>Q</b>: Are the stickers permanent?<br>
            A: The stickers are made with permanent vinyl which means that they should not peel off unless forced. Normal wear and tear might occur and result in corners rising, however you can use mod-podge to seal the sticker if you so choose.<br>
